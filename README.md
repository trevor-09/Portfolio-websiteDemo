# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background.

## Project Overview

The website is a single-page application built with a mobile-first approach. It includes four main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The entire project was developed using only **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on clean code, responsive design, and good UI/UX practices.

## My Experience Building This Project

Building this portfolio was a fantastic, hands-on learning experience. I moved from concept to a fully responsive website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS. A major highlight was implementing responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid, especially for the project showcase. I also learned practical debugging skills while troubleshooting image paths and asset management. This project not only solidified my technical skills in utility-first CSS but also gave me the confidence to build and finalize a complete, polished web application from start to finish.
